# 🏞️ Scenic India Gallery

A beautiful and responsive image gallery showcasing breathtaking views from across India. This project is built using HTML and CSS, with a focus on a clean layout, appealing visuals, and smooth user interactions. It also incorporates the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library for subtle scroll animations.

## ✨ Features

* **Captivating Header:** A prominent title to welcome visitors to the gallery.
* **Responsive Grid Layout:** Images are arranged in a dynamic grid that adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes:
    * **Desktop:** 4 columns
    * **Tablet:** 2 columns
    * **Mobile:** 1 column
* **Hover Effects:** Images zoom slightly and lift when hovered over, providing an interactive and engaging experience.
* **Animate On Scroll (AOS):** Images fade in subtly as they come into view, enhancing the visual appeal.
* **Modern Typography:** Utilizes Google Fonts ('Playfair Display' for headings and 'Poppins' for body text) for a polished and readable aesthetic.
* **Optimized Image Display:** Images are consistently sized and beautifully cropped using `object-fit: cover` and `aspect-ratio`.
